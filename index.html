			<img src="img/Bangladesh.jpg" style="width: 250px;">
			<p>The cyclone was downgraded to a depression as it swept north-eastwards from India into Bangladesh on Saturday, but was still powerful enough to submerge dozens of villages on the low lying coast.
			Gusts of up to 70km/h (43mph) were registered.<br>
			Houses were also destroyed in the Noakhali district, where 30 people were injured and two children killed, one aged 12 and another two years old.<br>
			India also moved more than a million people to safety to avoid Cyclone Fani.
			A least 16 people were killed by the storm when it hit India on Friday, but officials said the loss of life could have been far worse.<br>
			In 1999, a super-cyclone in the Bay of Bengal ravaged the coast of Orissa for 30 hours and killed 10,000 people.
			Early cyclone warning systems have since improved, giving authorities more time to evacuate people. The chief minister of Orissa said this was one of the largest evacuations in human history.<br>

			<img src="img/Avengers.jpg" style="width: 700px;">
			<p><b>Avengers: Endgame broke all box office records last weekend and has confirmed Disney's dominance in global cinema.</b><br>
			More than 90% of the value of all tickets sold in UK cinemas last weekend was for Avengers: Endgame.
			Within five days it had become the fastest film to break the $1bn sales barrier worldwide.<br>
			But more significantly, it is the latest evidence that Walt Disney is now the world's biggest box-office player.
			Of the 10 films with the biggest worldwide sales in their opening weekend, Disney has distributed five.
			Variety magazine reported that Disney took one fifth of all global box office takings in 2018.<br>
			The root of Disney's success lies in shrewd purchases: Pixar (Toy Story) in 2006, Marvel Entertainment in 2009, LucasFilms (Star Wars) in 2012 and then the film studios of 21st Century Fox (Avatar, X-Men, Planet of the Apes, Kingsman) in March this year.<br>
			Endgame is now the 22nd film in the Marvel Avengers series based in the fictional Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).
			Superhero films have long been a Hollywood mainstay, but the MCU, by populating its world with a range of characters as well as stories, has turned out to be the most successful film franchise to date.<br>
			Richard Broughton, research director at media research group Ampere Analysis, said: "Franchises are particularly suited to big studios that are reluctant to take risks on new titles.
			"And for Disney it was a happy accident that the early titles, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk and Thor, struck a chord - and it rolled on from there."<br>
			And the rewards have been spectacular. The top 10 Marvel films have pulled in more than $12bn (Â£9.2bn) at the box office.

			<img src="img/nature.jpg" style="width: 250px;">
			<p>The felling of forests, the plundering of seas and soils, and the pollution of air and water are together pushing the natural world to the brink.<br>
			That's the warning more than 500 experts in 50 countries are expected to give in a major UN-backed report, due to be published on Monday.<br>
			The assessment will highlight the losses that have hit the natural world over the past 50 years and how the future is looking bleak for tens to hundreds of thousands of species.<br>
			The document, from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), is also expected to set out an urgent rescue plan for nature.<br>
			Scientists believe the Earth is being driven towards a "mass extinction event" - only the sixth in the last half-billion years.
			"There is now overwhelming evidence that we are losing the planet's species at an alarming speed," Prof Alexandre Antonelli, the director of science at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, told BBC News.<br>
			The last time we had a similar situation was about 66 million years ago, which was caused by an asteroid hitting Earth, he said, though this time, "humans are the ones to blame".
			Current extinction rates are about 1,000 times higher than before humans came along, and future rates are likely to about 10,000 times higher, according to estimates.
