				<b>HTML</b><br>
				HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and is the language of the web.<br>
				Put simply, HTML provides a way for the web designer to tell your web browser how to treat a particular piece of content. HTML contains a number of different tags that allow the designer to mark up their content with semantic meaning so that paragraphs are identified as text copy, while images are imported as images and so on.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Responsive Design</b><br>
				You can't have failed to have heard about the concept of responsive design. For the past several years this has been a real buzz word around the web, and it shows no signs of letting up. Clients have even started demanding responsive websites from their designers, often without fully understanding what it is that they're asking for!<br>

				In simple terms, a responsive design is one that adapts to the user's device and, in an ideal world, the user's context so that it displays the content required in the most appropriate and accessible manner, regardless of what kind of web-connected device is being used to view it. In practice this means a web page will re-paginated itself as the screen size reduces or increases, displaying in multiple columns when viewed on a desktop computer, but only a single column when viewed on a smartphone.

			<b>CSS</b><br>
				HTML isn't enough on its own to create beautiful web pages, however. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) provide a method for designers to create a visual set of rules that determine how different elements within a web page will be rendered on screen by the browser.<br>
				CSS allows things like the colour of text, the background, the size, shape and position of all the different parts of a page to be set.<br>

			</div>

			<div class="rightsection">
				<b>JavaScript</b><br>
				Finally, JavaScript is (as implied by the name) a scripting language that allows designers to create interactions on a web page.<br>
				Historically JavaScript was primarily used for form validation, and provided those annoying alert boxes that popped up when you forgot to enter your telephone number in the phone field. These days there are many more viable uses for JavaScript, including special visual effects, or the ability to load new content without having to reload the whole page.
